Characterizing the molecular spatial and temporal field of injury in early stage smoker non-small cell lung cancer patients after definitive surgery by expression profiling,Gene expression alterations in response to cigarette smoke have been characterized in normal-appearing bronchial epithelium of healthy smokers and it has been suggested that adjacent histologically normal tissue display tumor-associated molecular abnormalities.We sought to delineate the spatial and temporal molecular lung field of injury in smoker early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n=19) who were accrued into a surveillance clinical trial for annual follow-up and bronchoscopies within one year after definitive surgery.,"Bronchial brushings and biopsies were obtained from six different sites in the lung at the time of inclusion in the study and at 12, 24 and 36 months after the first time point. Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used for whole-transcript expression profiling of airways (n=391). Mixed-effects models were performed to determine significant differential gene expression modulation by site from tumor and time following inclusion in the study within the molecular field of injury.",Humam Kadara,University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,Houston,TX,USA,GPL6244,391,GSE40407,GSE40407,GSE40407_RAW.tar,1.6 Gb,TAR (of CEL),,,,

Microbial community structure and functions are resilient to metal pollution along two forest soil gradients,"Despite the global importance of forests, it is virtually unknown how their soil microbial communities adapt at the phylogenetic and functional level to long term metal pollution. Studying twelve sites located along two distinct gradients of metal pollution in Southern Poland revealed that both community composition (via MiSeq Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes) and functional gene potential (using GeoChip 4.2) were highly similar across the gradients despite drastically diverging metal contamination levels. Metal pollution level significantly impacted microbial community structure (p = 0.037), but not bacterial taxon richness. Metal pollution altered the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa, including Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria. Also, a group of metal resistance genes showed significant correlations with metal concentrations in soil, although no clear impact of metal pollution levels on overall functional diversity and structure of microbial communities was observed. While screens of phylogenetic marker genes, such as 16S rRNA, provided only limited insight into resilience mechanisms, analysis of specific functional genes, e.g. involved in metal resistance, appeared to be a more promising strategy. This study showed that the effect of metal pollution on soil microbial communities was not straightforward, but could be filtered out from natural variation and habitat factors by multivariate statistical analysis and spatial sampling involving separate pollution gradients.","12 samples were collected from two long-term polluted areas (Olkusz and Miasteczko ÅlÄskie) in Southern Poland. In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 50 NSCLC cases, followed up more than five years, was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8,644 unique genes, leading to the successful construction of supervised",Hamed Azarbad,Jagiellonian University,Krakow,,Poland,GPL18982,12,GSE59620,GSE59620,GSE59620_raw_data.txt.gz,4.5 Mb,TXT,azarbad.hamed@gmail.com,48531527761,,
Transcriptional profiling of lung tumour cell lines with distinct p53 mutations in the absence or presence of WT p53,"Microarray expression data generated to determine the impact of defined p53 mutations on lung cancer cell phenotypes, and on the tumour supressive responses induced by WT p53 restoration.In murine models of lung cancer, the therapeutic benefit of WT p53 restoration has been demonstrated in p53-deficient tumours (Juntilla et al, 2010; Feldser et al, 2010). However, it remains unknown if the restoration of WT p53 function is beneficial in p53 mutant tumours. Thus, to determine the impact of p53-targeted therapy in mutant p53 lung cancer, we analysed cells from murine lung tumours of distinct p53 genotypes. Utilising the well characterised p53-ER allele (Christophorou et al, 2005; Martins et al, 2006; Juntilla et al, 2010) we carried out transcriptional profiling of KrasG12D/+ cell lines isolated from advanced lung tumours with defined p53 status: p53Fx/ER (null), p53R270H/ER and p53R172H/ER in the absence (p53 WT OFF) or presence (p53 WT ON) of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). The temporal specificity of p53-ER restoration allowed us to utilised two timepoints to determine both the immediate (2hr) and sustained (8hr) impact of WT p53 function.","Murine tumour cell lines were isolated from independent advanced KrasG12D/+; p53Fx/ER (null), p53R270H/ER and p53R172H/ER lung tumours (minimum of 2 tumour mice/genotype used) 21-22 weeks post 5x106 PFU adenocre intranasal administration.

Transcript analysis of multi-locus sampled tumor tissue in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,"we investigated the spatial features of surgically-removed biopsies from multiple loci in tumor masses of 15 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We observed that the immune microenvironment is highly spatial heterogeneous such that intra-tumoral regional variation is as large as inter-personal variation. While the local mutational burden was associated with local T cell clonal expansion, observed local anti-tumor cytotoxicity is strongly associated with local tumoral circumstance rather than TMB alone","We recruited 15 newly-diagnosed NSCLC patients who had surgery with curative intent, and multiple biopsy samples were collected from each individual tumor mass according to previously method.

Global DNA methylation reflects spatial heterogeneity and molecular evolution of lung adenocarcinomas,"Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer and characterized by considerable morphological and mutational heterogeneity. However, little is known about the epigenomic intratumor variability between spatially separated histological growth patterns of ADC. In order to reconstruct the clonal evolution of histomorphological growth patterns, we performed global DNA methylation profiling of 27 primary tumor regions, seven matched normal tissues, and six lymph node metastases from seven ADC cases. Additionally, we investigated the methylation data from 369 samples of the TCGA ADC cohort. All regions showed varying degrees of methylation changes between segments of different, but also of the same growth patterns. Similarly, copy number variations were seen between spatially distinct segments of each patient. Hierarchical clustering of promoter methylation revealed extensive heterogeneity within and between the cases. Intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity demonstrated a branched clonal evolution of ADC regions driven by genomic instability with subclonal copy number changes. Notably, methylation profiles within tumors were not more similar to each other than to those from other individuals. In two cases, different tumor regions of the same individuals were represented in distant clusters of the TCGA cohort, illustrating the extensive epigenomic intratumor heterogeneity of ADCs. Importantly, we found no evidence for the lymph node metastases to be derived from a common growth pattern. Instead, they had evolved early and separately from a particular pattern in each individual primary tumor. In summary, our results suggest that extensive variation of epigenomic features contributes to the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of primary ADCs and lymph node metastases.","The IlluminaHumanMethylationEPIC (Illumina, San Diego, USA) array data from n=40 different lung adenocarcinomas tissues were used to obtain genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation, according to the manufacturerâs instructions at the Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) as described previously (Pajtler et al.

Genome-wide co-localization of RNA-DNA interactions and fusion RNA pairs (RNAseq),"Despite the ever-increasing speed of detecting fusion transcripts in cancer, it remains formidable to predict what unreported RNA pairs can form new fusion transcripts.

Transcription and splicing kinetics are coordinated within both genes and higher-order chromatin domains [dataset1],"Here, we set out to understand if and how splicing kinetics are coordinated beyond individual intron removal and if this potential coordination could regulate alternative splicing outcomes. By measuring rates of transcription and splicing genome-wide, we found that the rate of splicing is coordinated across introns within individual genes. Furthermore, we found that elongation rates and splicing rates are coordinated within TADs, as are alternative splicing changes that result from cell type differences, differentiation programs, and alterations in splicing factor levels. Overall, our work establishes that the kinetics of transcription and splicing are coordinated within the spatial organization of the genome, which could be a control point for alternative splicing regulation that can modulate the function of a cell.",Nascent RNA-sequencing in two cell lines at 7 time points following 3hr DRB treatment and washoutPlease note that the *_steadyState samples represent those treated with DMSO as a vehicle control for 3 hours.,Alyssa Fronk,Envisagenics,Long Island City,NY,USA,GPL28205,36,GSE146161,GSE146161,GSE146161_RAW.tar,2.8 Gb,TAR (of BW),,,,

Spatial coupling of microbes and immune cells in solid malignancies [Whole_slides],"Solid tumors are composed of cancer cells and host immune cells that are distributed in a non-uniform pattern. Although this spatial heterogeneity may reflect mutational variations in cancer cells, mechanisms that direct the recruitment of immune cells to distinct regions within a tumor remain poorly understood. Here, we show that microbial-host interactions define tumor nests enriched in immune cells, and the distribution of microbes within tumors parallels the spatial heterogeneity of intratumoral lymphoid and myeloid cell populations. Analysis of human solid tumors revealed that the spatial distribution of immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, is markedly heterogeneous. Compared to T cell-poor (âcoldâ) tumor nests, T cell-rich (âhotâ) tumor nests displayed a significantly higher number of myeloid cells, B cells, and plasma cells. We performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNA sequencing to identify unique gene signatures that define tumor epithelium and stroma of cold and hot tumor nests. Cold tumor nests expressed genes that promote tumor proliferation and fibrosis, whereas hot tumor stroma and epithelium showed upregulation of immune-related processes, including responses to bacteria, and receptors that mediate mucosal immune responses to microbes, respectively. Consistent with these findings, we detected elevated levels of microbes within hot tumor nests in human pancreatic and lung cancers. Our data implicate host immune responses to microbes in defining intratumoral immune heterogeneity and highlight a potential role for crosstalks between microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system in regulating cancer immunogenicity.","RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks containing human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was analyzed using QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing.",Gregory L.

A Single-Cell Tumor Immune Atlas for Precision Oncology,"The tumor immune microenvironment is a main contributor to cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target for oncology. However, immune microenvironments vary profoundly between patients and biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response lack precision. A comprehensive compendium of tumor immune cells is required to pinpoint predictive cellular states and their spatial localization. We generated a single-cell resolved tumor immune cell atlas, jointly analyzing >500,000 cells from 217 patients and 13 cancer types, providing the basis for a patient stratification based on immune cell compositions. Projecting immune cells from external tumors onto the atlas facilitated an automated cell annotation system for a harmonized interpretation. To enable in situ mapping of immune populations for digital pathology, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that identified striking spatial immune cell patterns in tumor sections. We expect the atlas, together with our versatile toolbox for precision oncology, to advance currently applied stratification strategies for prognosis and immuno-therapy response.","Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on two human uveal melanoma cancers, one human ovarian cancer, one human uveal melanoma liver metastasis, one human non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis (including TCR), two human head and neck cancers and two mice colorectal cancers (one full and one only T cells and TCR)",Paula Nieto,CNAG,Barcelona,Spain,Spain,"GPL24247, GPL24676",10,GSE158803,GSE158803,GSE158803_RAW.tar,122.8 Mb,"TAR (of CSV, MTX, TSV)",nietogarciapaula@gmail.com,,CNAG,Single-Cell Genomics

These results emphasize an essential role of chromatin architecture in the determination of oncogenic programs and illustrate a relationship between gene expression, epigenome, 3D genome, and nuclear mechanics.","This submission contains RNA-seq, H3K9me3 ChIP-seq, H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, and Hi-C experiments on Control (CT) and SETDB1 loss-of-function mutation (KO) A549 cells.",Mikhail Magnitov,The Netherlands Cancer Institute,Amsterdam,,Netherlands,"GPL18573, GPL21290",40,GSE168233,GSE168233,GSE168233_gene_counts.txt.gz,610.9 Kb,TXT,,,,
Cell type inference in human lung tissue by domain adaptation of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data,"We developed a method, CellDART, which estimates the spatial distribution of cells defined by single-cell level data using domain adaptation of neural networks, and applied to the spatial mapping of human lung tissue. The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region.

Spatial coupling of microbes and immune cells in solid malignancies [Cold_hot_tumors_mouse],"Solid tumors are composed of cancer cells and host immune cells that are distributed in a non-uniform pattern. Growing evidence shows that intratumoral microbes are associated with immune microenvironments in cancer. However, mechanisms that direct the recruitment of microbes to tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that intratumoral infiltration of  immune cells and microbes are heterogeneous, and the distribution of microbes within tumors are orchestrated by the spatial heterogeneity of intratumoral lymphoid populations. Analysis of human solid tumors revealed that the spatial distribution of immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, is markedly heterogeneous. Compared to T cell-poor (âcoldâ) tumor nests, T cell-rich (âhotâ) tumor nests displayed a significantly higher number of myeloid cells, B cells, and plasma cells. We performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNA sequencing to identify unique gene signatures that define tumor epithelium and stroma of cold and hot tumor nests. Cold tumor nests expressed genes that promote tumor proliferation and fibrosis, whereas hot tumor stroma and epithelium showed upregulation of immune-related processes, including responses to bacteria, and receptors that mediate mucosal immune responses to microbes, respectively. Consistent with these findings, we detected elevated levels of microbes within hot tumor nests in human pancreatic and lung cancers as well as in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. Intratumoral T cell infiltration plays a causal role in spatial distribution of bacteria in tumor. Our data implicate intratumoral immune heterogeneity in defining microbial spatial distribution and highlight a potential role for crosstalks between microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system in shaping constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME).","RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections containing T cell-poor (""cold"") and T cell-rich (""hot"") tumors was analyzed using QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing.",Gregory L.

Perturb-map coupled with spatial transcriptomics identifies mutation associated gene signatures in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma,"The cellular architecture of a tumor has a major impact on cancer outcome, and thus there is interest in identifying genes controlling the tumor microenvironment (TME). While CRISPR screens are helping uncover genes regulating many cell-intrinsic processes, existing approaches are suboptimal for identifying gene functions operating extracellularly or within a tissue context. To address this, we developed an approach for spatial functional genomics called Perturb-map, which utilizes protein barcodes (Pro-Code) to enable spatial detection of barcoded cells within tissue. We applied Perturb-map to knockout dozens of genes in parallel in a mouse model of lung cancer and simultaneously assessed how each knockout influenced tumor growth, histopathology, and immune composition. Additionally, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased molecular analysis of Pro-Code/CRISPR lesions. Our studies found in Tgfbr2 knockout lesions, the TME was converted to a fibro-mucinous state and T-cells excluded, concomitant with upregulated TGFb and TGFb-mediated stroma activation, suggesting Tgfbr2 loss on lung cancer cells increased TGFb bioavailability and enhanced its suppressive effects on the TME.

A cellular hierarchy in melanoma uncouples growth and metastasis,"Although melanoma is notorious for its high degree of heterogeneity and plasticity, the origin and magnitude of cell state diversity remains poorly understood. Equally, it is not known whether melanoma growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. By combining mouse genetics, unbiased lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying embryonic neural crest cell fate specification and differentiation. Our findings indicate that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche environment, a phenotype acquired through a NOTCH3-dependent intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of melanoma cells is fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells harbouring a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitutes a pool of metastatic-initiating cells that can switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of cancer cell states within the evolving melanoma ecosystem and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of melanoma cells.

Gramd2+ alveolar type I cells can give rise to Kras-induced lung adenocarcinoma,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer and arises in the distal lung. LUAD encompasses several pathologic subtypes, including solid, lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, acinar and mixed subtypes, each with differing clinical outcomes or biological behavior. Specifically, lepidic histology is associated with improved survival relative to other LUAD histologies. Yet, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of these subtypes are largely unknown. Understanding which cell populations in the distal lung contribute to LUAD could provide insights for the marked heterogeneity in LUAD pathologic features, clinical presentation and responses to therapy.Recent studies have seen tumor-derived epithelial cells with an AT1 transcriptomic cell signature, suggesting AT1 cells may contribute to a subset of LUAD cases. We tested the ability of AT1 cells to give rise to LUAD by inducing KrasG12D, a known oncogenic driver in human LUAD. Activation of KrasG12D in Gram-domain containing 2 (Gramd2)+ AT1 cells gave rise to multiple LUAD lesions, primarily of papillary histology. In contrast, activation of KrasG12D in Sftpc+ AT2 cells resulted in LUAD lesions of lepidic histology. Immunohistochemistry established Gramd2:KrasG12D lesions were of primary lung origin and not metastatic events. Spatial transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct pathway alterations occurring within Gramd2- and Sftpc-derived LUAD. Immunofluorescence confirmed differences observed in the Spatial transcriptomic analysis in expression patterns and distribution of cell-specific markers between cell of origin, while universal upregulation of the Krt8 intermediate cell state marker was observed.

Systematic dissection of tumor-normal single-cell ecosystems across a thousand tumors of 30 cancer types,"The complexity of the tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges in cancer therapy. Here, to comprehensively investigate the tumor-normal ecosystems, we perform an integrative analysis of 4.9 million single-cell transcriptomes from 1,070 tumor and 493 normal samples in combination with pan-cancer 137 spatial transcriptomics, 8,887 TCGA, and 1,261 checkpoint inhibitor-treated bulk tumors. We define a myriad of cell states constituting the tumor-normal ecosystems and also identify hallmark gene signatures across different cell types and organs. Our atlas characterizes distinctions between inflammatory fibroblasts marked by AKR1C1 or WNT5A in terms of cellular interactions and spatial co-localization patterns. Co-occurrence analysis reveals interferon-enriched community states including tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) components, which exhibit differential rewiring between tumor, adjacent normal, and healthy normal tissues. The favorable response of interferon-enriched community states to immunotherapy is validated using immunotherapy-treated cancers (n=1,261) including our lung cancer cohort (n=497). Deconvolution of spatial transcriptomes discriminates TLS-enriched from non-enriched cell types among immunotherapy-favorable components.

HDAC2-SP1 orchestrated M2-like macrophage phenotype drives lung cancer growth â novel intervention strategy,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including anti-tumor M1-like TAMs and pro-tumor M2-like TAMs, are transcriptionally dynamic innate immune cells with diverse roles in lung cancer development. Epigenetic regulators are key controllers of macrophage fate in the spatially heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial proximity of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) â overexpressing M2-like macrophages to tumor cells significantly correlates with poor overall survival of lung cancer patients. Suppression of HDAC2 in TAMs altered macrophage polarization, migration, and associated signaling pathways related to interleukin, chemokine, cytokine, and T cell activation. In various co-culture systems of TAMs and cancer cells, suppressing HDAC2 in TAMs results in reduced proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis of cancer cell lines and primary lung cancer cells, as well as attenuated endothelial cell tube length. HDAC2 regulates the pro-tumor macrophage phenotype via acetylation of histone H3 and transcription factor SP1.

Interrogation of endothelial and mural cells in brain metastasis by multiomic analysis reveals key immune-regulatory mechanisms,"Brain metastasis (BrM) represents the most common and aggressive brain malignancy, predominantly arising from non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Recent studies have revealed the importance of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME), notably diverse immune cells, which play important roles in regulating cancer progression in both primary and metastatic brain malignancies. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is another critical TME component formed by endothelial cells, mural cells, astrocytic end-feet, and closely-associated microglial cells. Metastasizing cancer cells can utilize different strategies to traverse the BBB and once they have successfully seeded and colonized the brain, they can exploit the vasculature for their own benefit, forming the blood-tumor barrier.

Metastasizing cancer cells can utilize different strategies to traverse the BBB and once they have successfully seeded and colonized the brain, they can exploit the vasculature for their own benefit, forming the blood-tumor barrier. To explore the mechanisms underlying tumor vascularization in brain metastasis we performed a comprehensive multiomic analysis of the key components of the tumor vasculature. We integrated single-cell and/or bulk RNA sequencing of sorted endothelial and mural cells isolated from human and mouse BrM and non-tumor samples; immunofluorescence imaging analysis of the spatial architecture of the TME; and functional studies using BrM mouse models to target vascular regulators of tumor immunity. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the biology underlying vascularization in metastatic brain tumors, specifically highlighting the importance of vascular cells as immune regulators and proposing novel therapeutic strategies for these aggressive tumors.",Expression profile of endothelial and mural cells in BrM versus non-tumor brain tissue.,Nadine Fournier,Agora Cancer Research Center & Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics,Lausanne,Vaud,Switzerland,GPL24247,28,GSE228355,GSE228355,GSE228355_raw.count.matrix.pdgfrb.cd31.txt.gz,1.2 Mb,TXT,nadine.fournier@sib.swiss,,,Translational Data Science Facility
PD-1 blockade potentiates neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC via increasing CD127+ and KLRG1+ CD8 T cells,"The combination of PD-1 blockade with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has achieved unprecedented clinical success in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to NAC alone, but the underlying mechanisms by which PD-1 blockade augments the effects of chemotherapy remain incompletely elucidated. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CD45+ immune cells isolated from surgically resected fresh tumor tissues of seven NSCLC patients receiving NAC or neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (NAPC). Multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on paired FFPE tissues before and after NAC or NAPC from 65 resectable NSCLC patients, and results were validated with GEO dataset. NAC resulted in an increase only of CD20+ B cells, whereas NAPC increased the infiltration of CD20+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD127+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD8+CD127+ and CD8+KLRG1+ T cells. Synergistic increase in B and T cells promotes favorable therapeutic response after NAPC. Spatial distribution analysis discovered that CD8+ T cells and their CD127+ and KLRG1+ subsets were in closer proximity to CD4+ T/CD20+ B cells in NAPC versus NAC. GEO dataset validated that B-cell, CD4, memory and effector CD8 signatures correlated with therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes. The adding of PD-1 blockade to NAC promoted anti-tumor immunity through T and B cells recruitment in the tumor microenvironment and induced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells skewed toward CD127+ and KLRG1+ phenotypesï¼which may be assisted by CD4+ T cells and B cells. Our comprehensive study identified key immune cell subsets exerting anti-tumor responses during PD-1 blockade therapy and that may be therapeutically targeted to improve upon existing immunotherapies for NSCLC.","Xiubao,Ren",Xiubao Ren,"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital,",Tianjin,,China,GPL20795,7,GSE229353,GSE229353,GSE229353_RAW.tar,155.5 Mb,"TAR (of MTX, TSV)",renxiubao@tjmuch.com,,,
Systematic investigation of mitochondrial transfer between cancer cells and T cells at single-cell resolution,"Mitochondrion (MT) as the energy-producing organelle participates in most metabolic activities of mammalian cells. Unidirectional mitochondrial transfer from T cells to cancer cells was recently observed âmetabolically empoweringâ cancer cells while âdepleting immune cellsâ, providing new insights into Tumor-T cell interaction and immune evasion. Here, we leveraged the increasingly adopted single-cell RNA-seq technology and introduced MERCI, a statistical deconvolution method for tracing and quantifying the process of mitochondrial trafficking between cancer and T cells. MERCI was benchmarked using data generated from a coculture system of MT-labeled cancer and T cells to accurately predict the recipient cells and their mitochondrial compositions. We independently demonstrated the cellular MT transfer signals and validated the MERCI performance by additionally generating a gold-standard mtscATAC-seq dataset. Application of MERCI to single cell human cancer samples identified a novel MT transfer phenotype and its signature genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, energy production and TNFÎ± signaling pathways. Application of MERCI to ovarian cancer spatial transcriptomes revealed the prevalence of MT transfer in the tumor tissue of high T cell infiltration, which is elevated in the endothelium-rich regions. Finally, MT transfer is associated with high cell cycle activity and poor clinical outcome in our pan-cancer analysis through MERCI. In summary, MERCI enabled systematic investigation of a novel aspect of Tumor-T cell interaction and revealed MT-transfer related genes and pathways that may lead to new therapeutic opportunities.","The KP lung cancer cells were provided initially by Dr. Esra Akbay. The KP-mito-DsRed stable cell line was generated in the lab with pDsRed2-Mito vector transfection using PEI MAXÂ® with long-term selection using G418 following manufactureâs protocol. All cancer cell lines were grown in 5% FBS supplemented RPMI 1640. Cell lines were routinely tested using a mycoplasma contamination and cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 Ö¯C. Splenocytes were isolated by harvesting the spleen from 6-8 weeks old mice following red blood cell lysis with ACK buffer. CD8+ T cells were isolated by immunomagnetic negative selection using EasySepTM mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit. Isolated T cells were then stained with MitoTrackerTM green FM at 100 nM concentration at 37Â°C for 30 min following the manufacturerâs instruction. MitoTrackerTM green FM at indicated concentration would not stain all T cell mitochondria positive, to avoid non-mitochondrial labeling. Stained CD8+ T cells were then washed with medium, centrifuged down, and then resuspended to remove access dye in the medium. Isolated CD8+ T cells were maintained in 10% heat deactivated FBS supplemented RPMI 1640.

The KP-mito-DsRed stable cell line was generated in the lab with pDsRed2-Mito vector transfection using PEI MAXÂ® with long-term selection using G418 following manufactureâs protocol. All cancer cell lines were grown in 5% FBS supplemented RPMI 1640. Cell lines were routinely tested using a mycoplasma contamination and cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 Ö¯C. Splenocytes were isolated by harvesting the spleen from 6-8 weeks old mice following red blood cell lysis with ACK buffer. CD8+ T cells were isolated by immunomagnetic negative selection using EasySepTM mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit. Isolated T cells were then stained with MitoTrackerTM green FM at 100 nM concentration at 37Â°C for 30 min following the manufacturerâs instruction. MitoTrackerTM green FM at indicated concentration would not stain all T cell mitochondria positive, to avoid non-mitochondrial labeling. Stained CD8+ T cells were then washed with medium, centrifuged down, and then resuspended to remove access dye in the medium. Isolated CD8+ T cells were maintained in 10% heat deactivated FBS supplemented RPMI 1640. In the control experiment, KP-mito-DsRed cancer cells were labeled with MitoTrackerTM red CMXRos using the same procedure. scRNA-seq was performed by the 10x Genomics single-cell 5â² V(D)J library platform. Single-cell suspension of negative controls and sorted cells were counted manually under a microscope stained with trypan blue. The concentration of single-cell suspensions was adjusted to 900-1000 live cell/Î¼l. Cells were loaded at 10,000 cells/chip position. Single-cell libraries were generated with Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit (10x Genomics, PN-10000006, PN-10000009) following per manufacturerâs instruction. Purified libraries were analyzed by Illumina NovaSeq with 150-bp paired-end reads at a targeted median read depth of 100,000 reads per cell. Mitochondrial single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) technique was performed strictly following the revised 10x scATAC-seq protocol developed by Lareau et al. Briefly, after washing, the sorted cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT, quenched with glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 M before washing cells twice in PBS via centrifugation at 400 g, 5 min, 4Â°C. Cells were subsequently treated with lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP40, 1% BSA) for 3 min for CD8+ T cells and 5 min for KP cells on ice, followed by adding 1 ml of chilled wash buffer and inversion (10mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 1% BSA) before centrifugation at 500 g, 5 min, 4Â°C. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were diluted in 1x Diluted Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics) before counting using Trypan Blue and a Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen). mtscATAC-seq libraries were generated using the 10x Chromium Controller and the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Kit v2 (PN-1000406) according to the manufacturerâs instructions (CG000496 Rev-B), and sequencing was run on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Novogene) using paired-end sequencing of 150-bp read length, aiming to allocate 35,000 paired-end reads per cell in a mtscATAC-seq library.",Bo Li,"The Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania",Philadelphia,PA,USA,GPL24247,9,GSE235675,GSE235675,GSE235675_cell_information_bench2_scRNAseq_.txt.gz,41.5 Kb,TXT,lib3@chop.edu,7345467574,Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine,Bo Li lab
Systematic investigation of mitochondrial transfer between cancer cells and T cells at single-cell resolution,"Mitochondrion (MT) as the energy-producing organelle participates in most metabolic activities of mammalian cells. Unidirectional mitochondrial transfer from T cells to cancer cells was recently observed âmetabolically empoweringâ cancer cells while âdepleting immune cellsâ, providing new insights into Tumor-T cell interaction and immune evasion. Here, we leveraged the increasingly adopted single-cell RNA-seq technology and introduced MERCI, a statistical deconvolution method for tracing and quantifying the process of mitochondrial trafficking between cancer and T cells. MERCI was benchmarked using data generated from a coculture system of MT-labeled cancer and T cells to accurately predict the recipient cells and their mitochondrial compositions. We independently demonstrated the cellular MT transfer signals and validated the MERCI performance by additionally generating a gold-standard mtscATAC-seq dataset. Application of MERCI to single cell human cancer samples identified a novel MT transfer phenotype and its signature genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, energy production and TNFÎ± signaling pathways.

Through a large-scale CRISPR screen, we discovered that tumor-derived lactic acid, PGE2, and GM-CSF collaboratively shape the highly conserved but mutually exclusive TAM phenotypes: MHC-II+ and angiogenic TAMs. Mechanistically, the dichotomous nature of these two phenotypes is driven by the antagonistic interactions between lactic acid/PGE2 and GM-CSF. Lactic acid and PGE2 coordinately induce the angiogenic gene program while suppressing the GM-CSF-induced MHC-II program at chromatin level.

Contribution of crosstalk of mesothelial and tumoral epithelial cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer,"Tumor metastasis commonly affects pleura in advanced lung cancer and is related to poor prognosis, but without systematic investigation on different cell types and their crosstalk at single cell resolution. Here, by integrating 180785 single cells from lung cancer and control samples, the most distinctive transcriptome profiles between tumor and control were revealed in mesothelial cells, which is the predominate cell type of pleura. Four subtypes were divided, including one predominately identified in malignant pleural effusion which was characterized by enriched cancer related pathways (e.g., cell migration) along evolutionary trajectory from normal mesothelial cells. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells exhibited varied interactions with different subtypes of malignant epithelial cells, and multiple ligands/receptors exhibited significant correlation with poor prognosis. Experimentally, mesothelial cells can increase the migration ability of lung cancer cells through co-culturing assay, and EGFR was the only affected gene in cancer cells that exhibited interaction with mesothelial cells and was associated with poor prognosis. Using EGFR antagonist cetuximab prevented the increased invasiveness of lung cancer cells induced by mesothelial cells. Moreover, EPGN-EGFR interaction was supported through spatial distribution analysis, revealing the significant proximity between EPGN+ mesothelial cells and EGFR+ epithelial cells. Our findings highlighted the important role of mesothelial cells and their interactions with cancer cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer, which may facilitate cancer progression.","After co-culture, the RNA of A549 and MET-5A cells of control group and co-culture group was respectively extracted, which were further sequenced",Heng Xu,Sichuan University,Chengdu,Sichuan,China,GPL24676,12,GSE242951,GSE242951,GSE242951_counts.txt.gz,453.3 Kb,TXT,xuheng81916@gmail.com,+86-15928058711,,
Olfactory neuroblastoma mimics molecular subtypes and lineage trajectories of small cell lung cancer [Spatial transcriptomics on de-identified human ONB samples],"The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticityâas evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment.","We performed multiplexed and spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling using the NanoString GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform, with mostly default parameters. 5 Âµm sections from high quality archival ONB tissue blocks was mounted on glass slides for profiling. In total, we included 12 seperate ONB specimens, and 1 normal control OE. Two adjacent sections were cut and positioned on separate slides to allow for side-by-side H&E comparison. Following deparaffinization, antigen retrieval was performed with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) in a steamer for 20 min. Slides were then incubated for 15 min at 37Â°C in PBS buffer with 0.1 Âµg/mL proteinase K for RNA target exposure. In situ hybridization was conducted by incubating slides with GeoMx Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas Probe Mix (NanoString) overnight at 37Â°C. Slides were then stained with fluorescence-conjugated morphology markers for two hr at RT with the following labels: Syto 83 nuclear dye (NanoString) 250nM, CD45-532 (NovusBio cat# NBP2-34528AF532) 7.50Âµg/mL, TUBB3-594 (Biolegend, cat# 657408) 1:50, KI67-647 (CST cat# 12075) 1:100. Slides were then loaded on the NanoString GeoMx DSP instrument, and 2-3 representative ROIs in spatially distinct locations were selected based on tumor morphology and antibody staining markers. In general, ROIs were 200-600Âµm in diameter, and contained 100-300 nuclei. Note, some tumor specimens also contained normal overlying OE, which was captured for controls. ROIs were then segmented based on morphology markers, and RNA probe oligos were photocleaved and collected in the following order: CD45, KI-67, TUBB3, negative. Oligos were then processed for library preparation according to the standard Nanostring protocol, with the exception that beads were dried for 1 min instead of 5.

Immunogenomics and spatial proteomic mapping highlight distinct neuro-immune architectures in melanoma vs. non-melanoma-derived brain metastasis,"Brain metastases (BrMs) are a devastating complication of solid tumors with challenging clinical management. In this study, immunogenomic and digital spatial analyses were applied to interrogate the peripheral blood and tumor specimens derived from 53 unique patients with metastatic brain tumors originating from different solid tumors including melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In the peripheral blood, lower levels of neutrophil -lymphocytes ratio (NLR) were detected at time of craniotomy in patients with melanoma-derived brain metastasis (MBM) vs. non-melanoma- derived brain metastasis (non-MBM). Independently from the primary tumor of derivation, patients with BrMs and increased NLR levels were characterized by shorter overall survival (OS) following craniotomy. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), molecular evaluations performed on FFPEs revealed higher expression of genes and mRNA signatures identifying NK cells, CD8 cells and B cells in MBM (n=13) vs. non-MBM brain metastasis (n=41). Focusing on CD8 cells, higher infiltration of CD8+ cells were observed in patients with MBM with longer OS following craniotomy. Spatial proteomic analysis further highlighted the infiltration of CD8+ cells, antigen presenting cells- (HLA-DR+, CD11c+, B2M+), agonists of T cell activity (CD137+, CD40+) and B cells (CD20+) enriched in MBM vs non-MBM. On the contrary, an increased expression of genes associated with neuro-development, cell- cell adhesion, neutrophil enrichment together with the increased infiltrations of cells promoting neuro-differentiation (Neun+, S100+), immune regulatory functions (CD25+, CD127+), and granulocytes aggregation (CD66b+) were observed in non-MBM vs. MBM. These findings highlight that the TME of BrMs plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance of BrMs derived from different solid tumors. Our results also suggest that distinct neuro-immune interplay may contribute to treatment resistance in BrMs.","To comprehensively examine the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment of metastases derived from different solid tumors, we analyzed a set of surgically resected BrMs originated from different solid tumors including melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), using whole gene expression profile, digital spatial proteomics (DSP), immunohistochemistry (IHC), multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), and spectral flow cytometry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor biposies were derived from  13 MBM and 41 non-MBM [18 lung cancer-derived brain metastasis (LBM), 18 breast cancer-derived brain metastasis (BBM) and 5 renal cancer-derived brain metastasis (RCM) biopsies.

Gene expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days),"Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies.","On the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, regions of interest of 250 micrometers in diameter were selected in the pre-treatment biopsy (15) and tepotinib-treated surgical resection (79) from the same patient, following hybridization of tissue with Cancer Transcriptome Atlas probes and custom probes for METex14, CLDN18.1, CLDN18.2, CEACAM5, spliced XBP1 and morphology marker staining using SYTO13, TTF1, CD3 and CD33.",Manon A Simard,Merck Healthcare KGaA,Darmstadt,,Germany,GPL33991,94,GSE249568,GSE249568,GSE249568_RAW.tar,2.9 Mb,TAR (of DCC),manon.simard@merckgroup.com,,Research Unit Oncology,

Aberrant activation of wound healing programs within the metastatic niche facilitates lung colonization by osteosarcoma cells,"Purpose: Lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor. How malignant bone cells coerce the lung microenvironment to support metastatic growth is unclear. This study delineates how osteosarcoma cells educate the lung microenvironment during metastatic progression.   Experimental design: Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), we characterized genome- and tissue-wide molecular changes induced within lung tissues by disseminated osteosarcoma cells in both immunocompetent murine models of metastasis and patient samples. We confirmed transcriptomic findings at the protein level and determined spatial relationships with multi-parameter immunofluorescence. We evaluated the ability of nintedanib to  impair metastatic colonization and prevent osteosarcoma-induced education of the lung microenvironment in both immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma and immunodeficient human xenograft models. Results: Osteosarcoma cells induced acute alveolar epithelial injury upon lung dissemination. scRNA-seq demonstrated that the surrounding lung stroma adopts a chronic, non-resolving wound-healing phenotype similar to that seen in other models of lung injury. Accordingly, metastasis-associated lung demonstrated marked fibrosis, likely due to the accumulation of pathogenic, pro-fibrotic, partially-differentiated epithelial intermediates.  Inhibitionintermediates. Inhibition of fibrotic pathways with nintedanib prevented metastatic progression in multiple murine and human xenograft models. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that osteosarcoma cells co-opt fibrosis to promote metastatic outgrowth. When harmonized with data from adult epithelial cancers, our results support a generalized model wherein aberrant mesenchymal-epithelial interactions are critical for promoting lung metastasis. Adult epithelial carcinomas induce fibrotic pathways in normal lung fibroblasts, whereas osteosarcoma, a pediatric mesenchymal tumor, exhibits fibrotic reprogramming in response to the aberrant wound-healing behaviors of an otherwise normal lung epithelium, which are induced by tumor cell interactions.","We utilized multiple immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma lung metastasis models coupled with single-cell RNA transcriptomics to characterize the cellular and molecular changes induced to the lung microenvironment by disseminated osteosarcoma cells. Transcriptomic findings were confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemistry in mouse models as well as human patient samples. We tested the effect of nintedanib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for its ability to impair metastasis and prevent osteosarcoma education of the lung microenvironment in both immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma models and immunodeficient human xenograft models.",Matt Cannon,Nationwide Children's Hospital,Columbus,OH,USA,"GPL24247, GPL30172",10,GSE252703,GSE252703,GSE252703_RAW.tar,845.2 Mb,TAR (of TAR),matthewvc1@gmail.com,,Center for Childhood Cancer,

Anti-tumor activity of a novelLAIR1antagonist in combination with anti-PD-1to treat collagen-rich solid tumors (GeoMx),"We recently reported that resistance to PD-1-blockade in a refractory lung cancer-derived model involved increased collagen deposition and the collagen-binding inhibitory receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1), and thus we hypothesized that LAIR1 and collagen cooperated to suppress therapeutic response. Here, we report LAIR1 is associated with tumor stroma and is highly expressed by intratumoral myeloid cells in both human tumors and mouse models of cancer. Stroma-associated myeloid cells exhibit a suppressive phenotype and correlate with LAIR1 expression in human cancer. NGM438, a novel humanized LAIR1 antagonist monoclonal antibody, elicits myeloid inflammation and allogeneic T cell responses by binding to LAIR1 and blocking collagen engagement. Further, a mouse-reactive NGM438 surrogate antibody sensitized refractory KP mouse lung tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy and resulted in increased intratumoral CD8+ T cell content and inflammatory gene expression. These data place LAIR1 at the intersection of stroma and suppressive myeloid cells and support the notion that blockade of the LAIR1/collagen axis can potentially address resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in the clinic.","Freshly cut sections were first confirmed to contain adequate RNA quality using RNAscope LS 2.5 Probe Hs-PPIB (Advanced Cell Diagnostic, 313908).

SFRP2+ CAFs Hinder Abscopal Effect from Combined Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy by Forming a Hostile Perivascular Niche,"Despite accumulating cases of radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect in the lung cancer with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the occurrence of this effect remains infrequent and unpredictable to be a therapeutic goal.

Spatially resolved whole-transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of lung cancer and immune-microenvironment according to PD-L1 expression,"The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Structural and molecular properties of inclusion bodies of mumps virus,"Viral RNA synthesis of mononegaviruses occurs in the cytoplasmic membrane-less organelles called as inclusion body (IB). Here, we reported that the IBs of mumps virus (MuV), which is the causative agent of mumps and belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, had properties of liquid organelles formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Super-resolution microscopic analysis of the MuV IBs demonstrated that nucleocapsid and phospho-(P) proteins formed the cage-like structure and that viral polymerase was in a reticular pattern and partially co-localized with viral mRNA. In addition, we characterized host RNAs localized in the MuV IBs by a spatial transcriptome analysis and found that G-quadruplex motif sequences containing RNAs (G4-RNAs) were concentrated. In vitro phase separation assay showed that the G4-RNAs interacted with the P protein and enhanced condensation in the P droplets.

"Complex interaction of tumor-derived factors instructs the niche specific phenotypes of tumor-associated macrophages (CROP-Seq, in vivo LGP pool)","Despite the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in modulating anti-tumor immunity, the molecular determinants of their functional phenotypes remain elusive. Through a large-scale CRISPR screen, we discovered that tumor-derived lactic acid, PGE2, and GM-CSF collaboratively shape the highly conserved but mutually exclusive TAM phenotypes: MHC-II+ and angiogenic TAMs. Mechanistically, the dichotomous nature of these two phenotypes is driven by the antagonistic interactions between lactic acid/PGE2 and GM-CSF. Lactic acid and PGE2 coordinately induce the angiogenic gene program while suppressing the GM-CSF-induced MHC-II program at chromatin level. This mechanism leads to distinct spatial distribution of TAMs, with angiogenic TAMs in lactate-rich hypoxic regions and MHC-II+ TAMs outside these areas. Furthermore, in vivo genetic perturbation of TAMs showed that shifting TAMs to an interferon responsive program, triggered by Adar inactivation, substantially potentiates anti-tumor immunity. Our findings suggest a conserved mechanism of TAM polarization and a potential approach for reprogramming TAMs in immunotherapy.","To validate the effect of latic acid, PGE2 and GM-CSF in shaping TAM polarization in vivo, we characterize the phenotypes of TAMs pertubred the receptors of lactic acid, PGE2 and GM-CSF via pooled library(LGP pool).

Aberrant activation of wound healing programs within the metastatic niche facilitates lung colonization by osteosarcoma cells,"Purpose: Lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor. How malignant bone cells coerce the lung microenvironment to support metastatic growth is unclear. This study delineates how osteosarcoma cells educate the lung microenvironment during metastatic progression.   Experimental design: Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), we characterized genome- and tissue-wide molecular changes induced within lung tissues by disseminated osteosarcoma cells in both immunocompetent murine models of metastasis and patient samples. We confirmed transcriptomic findings at the protein level and determined spatial relationships with multi-parameter immunofluorescence. We evaluated the ability of nintedanib to  impair metastatic colonization and prevent osteosarcoma-induced education of the lung microenvironment in both immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma and immunodeficient human xenograft models. Results: Osteosarcoma cells induced acute alveolar epithelial injury upon lung dissemination. scRNA-seq demonstrated that the surrounding lung stroma adopts a chronic, non-resolving wound-healing phenotype similar to that seen in other models of lung injury. Accordingly, metastasis-associated lung demonstrated marked fibrosis, likely due to the accumulation of pathogenic, pro-fibrotic, partially-differentiated epithelial intermediates.  Inhibitionintermediates. Inhibition of fibrotic pathways with nintedanib prevented metastatic progression in multiple murine and human xenograft models. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that osteosarcoma cells co-opt fibrosis to promote metastatic outgrowth. When harmonized with data from adult epithelial cancers, our results support a generalized model wherein aberrant mesenchymal-epithelial interactions are critical for promoting lung metastasis. Adult epithelial carcinomas induce fibrotic pathways in normal lung fibroblasts, whereas osteosarcoma, a pediatric mesenchymal tumor, exhibits fibrotic reprogramming in response to the aberrant wound-healing behaviors of an otherwise normal lung epithelium, which are induced by tumor cell interactions.","We utilized multiple immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma lung metastasis models coupled with single-cell RNA transcriptomics to characterize the cellular and molecular changes induced to the lung microenvironment by disseminated osteosarcoma cells. Transcriptomic findings were confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemistry in mouse models as well as human patient samples.

Enhancing Immunotherapy Outcomes: Spatial Multi-Omics Predictive Models for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Nonâsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has an increasing number of targeted and systemic therapies allowing subsets of patients to achieve longâterm durable benefit. Fundamental to understanding responses to a given therapy is comprehensive molecular characterization of the underlying tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The TIME may inform models to predict immunotherapy outcomes and features to delineate therapeutic responses and clinical endpoints. We hypothesize that an integrated multiâomics approach will uncover interactions within the NSCLC TIME and identify novel biomarkers that are predictive of immunotherapy responses, thus aiding precision oncology. To develop a spatially resolved TIME model for NSCLC immunotherapy, we utilized a multiâomics approach, combining spatial mapping of protein expression at the singleâcell resolution by Phenocycler Fusion (PCF) and multiâcellular readout whole transcriptome profiling at cellular compartment resolution by Digital Spatial Profiling (DSPâGeoMxâWTA). This approach facilitated a detailed examination of the TIME in NSCLC samples from patients undergoing firstâline immunotherapy. We studied two independent cohorts of advanced NSCLC tissue samples, treated with PDâ1âbased immunotherapies. We derived gene signatures from cell type signatures to predict treatment outcomes using a multistage Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approach. Our spatial proteomic analysis identified three distinct cell types, proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes, and vessels, associated with resistance to immunotherapy. A high proportion of these cell types demonstrated a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.8 (p = 0.004) in the Yale training cohort and 1.8 (p = 0.05) in the UQ validation cohort. In the response cellâtype model, higher levels of M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and CD4 T cells had an HR of 0.4 (p = 0.019) in the training cohort and 0.49 (p = 0.036) in the validation. In the transcriptomic analysis, gene signatures derived from these cell types predicted outcomes with high accuracy. The resistance gene model, which included 8 genes associated with epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration, showed an HR of 5.3 (p < 0.001) in the Yale training cohort, 2.2 (p = 0.036) in the UQ validation cohort, and 1.7 (p = 0.042) in the Greece validation cohort. Conversely, the response gene model, consisting of 8 genes associated with immunomodulation, had an HR of 0.22 (p = 0.005) in the Yale training cohort, 0.38 (p = 0.034) in the UQ validation cohort, and 0.56 (p = 0.041) in the Greece validation cohort. Multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, disease stage, prior chemotherapy, type of immunotherapy, line of immunotherapy, histology, and smoking status, confirmed that the resistance signature remained significantly associated with worse outcomes, while the response signature remained associated with improved outcomes in both the UQ and Greece cohorts. This research highlights the potential of a multiâomics cell typing and gene expression profiling approach in advancing NSCLC treatment toward precision oncology. By offering insights into the TIME and unveiling novel biomarkers, our model seeks to define resistance and to improve prediction of response to treatment.","We utilized a multi-omics approach, combining CODEX for spatial mapping of protein expressions at the single-cell level and DSP-WTA for comprehensive transcriptomic insights from the cell types identified by CODEX.

It is still intriguing whether there is spatial control of m6A deposition on different types of RNAs. Here, through genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening based on a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) reporter, we find the H3K27ac acetylase p300 and PAK2 inhibit the interaction between METTL3 and METTL14. We further find that p300-catalyzed acetylation of METTL3 specifically occurs on H3K27ac marked chromatin. METTL3 acetylation suppresses the binding of METTL3 on H3K27ac-marked chromatin by inhibiting its interaction with METTL14. Disruptive K-to-R mutations on the three METTL3 acetylation sites promote the m6A of chromatin-associated RNAs transcribed from p300 bound enhancers and promoters marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me1-3 other than those regions marked by H3K36me3 and H3K9me3, resulting in degradation of eRNAs and paRNAs and transcription inhibition of ferroptosis-inhibition related genes. In addition, PAK2 promotes METTL3 acetylation by phosphorylating METTL3. Inhibition of PAK2 promotes the ferroptosis induced by RSL3, ML162, as well as the chemotherapy drug CDDP in a manner that depends on the acetylation of METTL3.

SFRP2+ CAFs Hinder Abscopal Effect from Combined Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy by Forming a Hostile Perivascular Niche [B16],"Despite accumulating cases of radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect in the lung cancer with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the occurrence of this effect remains infrequent and unpredictable to be a therapeutic goal. Here, we showed that the combination of radiotherapy (8Gy*3F) and ICI alleviated the tumor burden at the irradiated site whereas no discernible benefit was observed in the abscopal tumors. RNA-sequencing data showed that extracellular structure organization pathways were enriched in the abscopal tumors after combined therapy, with Sfrp2 being identified as a central hub. SFRP2 expression was observed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and was elevated in abscopal tumors after combined therapy. Blockade of SFRP2 followed by combined radiotherapy and ICI reinvigorated infiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, and elicited regression of abscopal tumors, which was abrogated by CD8Î± depletion. Mechanistically, in vitro experiments demonstrated that SFRP2+ CAFs induced apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. The spatial transcriptome analysis showed that SFRP2+ CAFs were located in proximity to the vessels and surrounded by abundant macrophages and limited CD8Tex, thereby creating an immunosuppressive perivascular niche, which was validated in paraffin sections of human lung cancer. Lineage-tracing assays showed SFRP2+ CAFs were derived from pericytes. IGF-1 released by irradiated tumors facilitated the transition of pericytes into fibroblasts and stimulated the expression of SFRP2. In summary, SFRP2+ CAFs hijack the abscopal effect from combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy via inducing apoptosis of CD8+ T cells and orchestrating a hostile perivascular niche in the lung cancer. Targeting SFRP2+ CAF may recondition the TME and promote the abscopal effect.",RNA-sequencing of B16 murine tumor specimens administered with different treatments: immune checkpoint inhibitor (3 replicates for this group) and radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy (3 replicates for this group).,Yanpei Zhang,Southern Medical University,Guangzhou,Guangdong,China,GPL24247,6,GSE283462,GSE283462,GSE283462_gene_count_matrix.csv.gz,562.4 Kb,CSV,,,,
In situ detection of PD1âPD-L1 interactions as a functional predictor for response to immune checkpoint inhibition in NSCLC.,"Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed lung cancer treatment, yet their effectiveness seem restricted to certain patient subsets. Current clinical stratification on the basis of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression offers limited predictive value. Given the mechanism of action, directly detecting spatial programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)âPD-L1 interactions might yield more precise insights into immune responses and treatment outcomes.Methods: We applied a second-generation in situ proximity ligation assay to detect PD1âPD-L1 interactions in diagnostic tissue samples from 16 different cancer types, a tissue microarray with surgically resected early-stage NSCLC, and finally diagnostic biopsies from 140 patients with advanced NSCLC with and without ICI treatment. RNA sequencing analysis was used to identify potential resistance mechanisms.Results: In the early-stage NSCLC, only approximately half of the cases with detectable PD-L1 and PD1 expression exhibited PD1âPD-L1 interactions, with significantly lower levels in EGFR-mutated tumors. Interaction levels varied across cancer types, aligning with reported ICI response rates. In ICI-treated patients with NSCLC, higher PD1âPD-L1 interactions were linked to complete responses and longer survival, outperforming standard PD-L1 expression assays. Patients who did not respond to ICIs despite high PD1âPD-L1 interactions exhibited additional expression of stromal immune mediators (EOMES, HAVCR1/TIM-1, JAML, FCRL1).Conclusion: Our study proposes a diagnostic shift from static biomarker quantification to assessing active immune pathways, providing more precise ICI treatment. This functional concept applies to tiny lung biopsies and can be extended to further immune checkpoints. Accordingly, our results indicate concerted ICI resistance mechanisms, highlighting the need for combination diagnostics and therapies.",RNA-seq samples from lung cancer patients that received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

DDX54 downregulation enhances anti-PD1 therapy in immune-desert lung tumors with high tumor mutational burden,"High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a predictive biomarker for the responsiveness of cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy that indicates whether immune cells can sufficiently recognize cancer cells as non-self. However, about 30% of all cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are classified as immune-desert tumors lacking T cell infiltration despite high TMB. Since the underlying mechanism of these immune-desert tumors has yet to be unraveled, there is a pressing need to transform such immune-desert tumors into immune-inflamed tumors and thereby enhance their responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. Here, we present a systems framework for identifying immuno-oncotargets, based on analysis of gene regulatory networks, and validating the effect of these targets in transforming immune-desert into immune-inflamed tumors. In particular, we identify DEAD-box helicases 54 (DDX54) as a master regulator of immune escape in immune-desert lung cancer with high TMB, and show that knockdown of DDX54 can increase immune cell infiltration and lead to improved sensitivity to anti-PD1 therapy.","This study employs a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer to investigate the role of Ddx54 in tumor biology and its interaction with anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Four formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were obtained from mice bearing Lewis Lung Carcinoma 1 (LLC1) tumors under distinct experimental conditions:1. Sample #1: Mice injected with wild-type (WT) LLC1 cells and treated with an isotype control antibody. 2. Sample #2: Mice injected with Ddx54 knockdown (KD) LLC1 cells and treated with an isotype control antibody. 3. Sample #3: Mice injected with WT LLC1 cells and treated with an anti-PD1 antibody. 4. Sample #4: Mice injected with Ddx54 KD LLC1 cells and treated with an anti-PD1 antibody.Each treatment group consists of replicates to ensure statistical robustness. Utilizing the Xenium Mouse 5K spatial transcriptomics workflow, spatial gene expression profiles were generated for each FFPE tissue block. This approach allows for the spatial mapping of transcriptomic changes within the tumor microenvironment, facilitating the comparison between WT and Ddx54 KD tumors under both control and immunotherapy conditions.
