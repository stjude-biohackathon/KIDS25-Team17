(Submitter supplied) Despite the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in modulating anti-tumor immunity, the molecular determinants of their functional phenotypes remain elusive. Through a large-scale CRISPR screen, we discovered that tumor-derived lactic acid, PGE2, and GM-CSF collaboratively shape the highly conserved but mutually exclusive TAM phenotypes: MHC-II+ and angiogenic TAMs. Mechanistically, the dichotomous nature of these two phenotypes is driven by the antagonistic interactions between lactic acid/PGE2 and GM-CSF. more...

4. KRAS G12C inhibition combined with CD47 and immune checkpoint blockage overcomes intrinsic resistance to concomitant KRAS G12C and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy
(Submitter supplied) Although KRAS G12C inhibitors have altered the treatment strategy of patients with KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer, their efficacy is insufficient to eliminate tumors. Here, we identified that inhibition of mutant KRAS promotes escape from macrophage phagocytosis by upregulating the expression of ‘don’t eat me’ signal proteins, including CD47. CD47 was induced by the binding of FOXA1 to the super-enhancer of CD47. more...

5. DDX54 downregulation enhances anti-PD1 therapy in immune-desert lung tumors with high tumor mutational burden
(Submitter supplied) High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a predictive biomarker for the responsiveness of cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy that indicates whether immune cells can sufficiently recognize cancer cells as non-self. However, about 30% of all cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are classified as immune-desert tumors lacking T cell infiltration despite high TMB. Since the underlying mechanism of these immune-desert tumors has yet to be unraveled, there is a pressing need to transform such immune-desert tumors into immune-inflamed tumors and thereby enhance their responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. more...

39. Anti-tumor activity of a novelLAIR1antagonist in combination with anti-PD-1to treat collagen-rich solid tumors (GeoMx)
(Submitter supplied) We recently reported that resistance to PD-1-blockade in a refractory lung cancer-derived model involved increased collagen deposition and the collagen-binding inhibitory receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1), and thus we hypothesized that LAIR1 and collagen cooperated to suppress therapeutic response. Here, we report LAIR1 is associated with tumor stroma and is highly expressed by intratumoral myeloid cells in both human tumors and mouse models of cancer. more...

(Submitter supplied) Brain metastasis (BrM) represents the most common and aggressive brain malignancy, predominantly arising from non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Recent studies have revealed the importance of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME), notably diverse immune cells, which play important roles in regulating cancer progression in both primary and metastatic brain malignancies. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is another critical TME component formed by endothelial cells, mural cells, astrocytic end-feet, and closely-associated microglial cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Solid tumors are composed of cancer cells and host immune cells that are distributed in a non-uniform pattern. Growing evidence shows that intratumoral microbes are associated with immune microenvironments in cancer. However, mechanisms that direct the recruitment of microbes to tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that intratumoral infiltration of  immune cells and microbes are heterogeneous, and the distribution of microbes within tumors are orchestrated by the spatial heterogeneity of intratumoral lymphoid populations. more...

50. HDAC2-SP1 orchestrated M2-like macrophage phenotype drives lung cancer growth – novel intervention strategy
(Submitter supplied) Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including anti-tumor M1-like TAMs and pro-tumor M2-like TAMs, are transcriptionally dynamic innate immune cells with diverse roles in lung cancer development. Epigenetic regulators are key controllers of macrophage fate in the spatially heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial proximity of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) – overexpressing M2-like macrophages to tumor cells significantly correlates with poor overall survival of lung cancer patients. more...

(Submitter supplied) Although melanoma is notorious for its high degree of heterogeneity and plasticity, the origin and magnitude of cell state diversity remains poorly understood. Equally, it is not known whether melanoma growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. By combining mouse genetics, unbiased lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying embryonic neural crest cell fate specification and differentiation. more...

(Submitter supplied) The cellular architecture of a tumor has a major impact on cancer outcome, and thus there is interest in identifying genes controlling the tumor microenvironment (TME). While CRISPR screens are helping uncover genes regulating many cell-intrinsic processes, existing approaches are suboptimal for identifying gene functions operating extracellularly or within a tissue context. To address this, we developed an approach for spatial functional genomics called Perturb-map, which utilizes protein barcodes (Pro-Code) to enable spatial detection of barcoded cells within tissue. more...

(Submitter supplied) To explore the diversity of the MF compartment in human non-small cell lung carcinoma lesions (NSCLC), we first performed an unbiased single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of CD45+ tumor-associated leukocytes. We identified distinct MF populations enriched in human tumors and found related MF phenotypes in mouse lung tumors. Using lineage-tracing, we discovered these discrete MF populations differ in origin and have a distinct temporal and spatial distribution in the TME. more...

72. A Single-Cell Tumor Immune Atlas for Precision Oncology
(Submitter supplied) The tumor immune microenvironment is a main contributor to cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target for oncology. However, immune microenvironments vary profoundly between patients and biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response lack precision. A comprehensive compendium of tumor immune cells is required to pinpoint predictive cellular states and their spatial localization. We generated a single-cell resolved tumor immune cell atlas, jointly analyzing >500,000 cells from 217 patients and 13 cancer types, providing the basis for a patient stratification based on immune cell compositions. more...

73. Global DNA methylation reflects spatial heterogeneity and molecular evolution of lung adenocarcinomas
(Submitter supplied) Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer and characterized by considerable morphological and mutational heterogeneity. However, little is known about the epigenomic intratumor variability between spatially separated histological growth patterns of ADC. In order to reconstruct the clonal evolution of histomorphological growth patterns, we performed global DNA methylation profiling of 27 primary tumor regions, seven matched normal tissues, and six lymph node metastases from seven ADC cases. more...

74. Genome-wide co-localization of RNA-DNA interactions and fusion RNA pairs (RNAseq)
(Submitter supplied) Despite the ever-increasing speed of detecting fusion transcripts in cancer, it remains formidable to predict what unreported RNA pairs can form new fusion transcripts. By systematic mapping of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) and their respective genomic interaction loci, we obtained genome-wide RNA-DNA interaction maps from two non-cancerous cell types. The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. more...

76. Transcript analysis of multi-locus sampled tumor tissue in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(Submitter supplied) we investigated the spatial features of surgically-removed biopsies from multiple loci in tumor masses of 15 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We observed that the immune microenvironment is highly spatial heterogeneous such that intra-tumoral regional variation is as large as inter-personal variation. While the local mutational burden was associated with local T cell clonal expansion, observed local anti-tumor cytotoxicity is strongly associated with local tumoral circumstance rather than TMB alone

(Submitter supplied) Microarray expression data generated to determine the impact of defined p53 mutations on lung cancer cell phenotypes, and on the tumour supressive responses induced by WT p53 restoration. In murine models of lung cancer, the therapeutic benefit of WT p53 restoration has been demonstrated in p53-deficient tumours (Juntilla et al, 2010; Feldser et al, 2010). However, it remains unknown if the restoration of WT p53 function is beneficial in p53 mutant tumours. more...

78. Microbial community structure and functions are resilient to metal pollution along two forest soil gradients
(Submitter supplied) Despite the global importance of forests, it is virtually unknown how their soil microbial communities adapt at the phylogenetic and functional level to long term metal pollution. Studying twelve sites located along two distinct gradients of metal pollution in Southern Poland revealed that both community composition (via MiSeq Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes) and functional gene potential (using GeoChip 4.2) were highly similar across the gradients despite drastically diverging metal contamination levels. more...
